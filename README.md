# EF-NETCore-ORM

This repo is intended to hold my studies on Object Relational Mapping topics using the EntityFramework extension for .NET. In this practical example, I'll cover Object Oriented Programming themes like Inheritance, Abstract Classes and Interfaces, and their uses within the proccess of mapping classes and objects to tables in Relational Databases. The project follows a DDD approach, and I've decided to stop the development at the point where I reached the migration of the Entity Classes to tables inside the PostgreSQL.
